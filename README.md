# TV_Script_Generation

### Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

### Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), in the ```project-tv-script-generation``` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
```

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with ```git pull```.

You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.

### Submission
1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.
2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2260/view).
3. When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as both an .ipynb file and as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the **File** menu in the notebook and choosing "Download as" > HTML. **Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together.**
4. Package the "dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb", "helper.py", "problem_unittests.py", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.
5. Hit Submit Project to submit your final zip file!
